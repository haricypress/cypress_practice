in BDD,
all ".feature" files giving priority as below for looking step implementations,

1) common/common.js
2) ".js" file name as ".feature" file name ( ex :  login.js, login.feature )
3) with other named "js" file ( ex :  employee.js, login.feature )

in "common" folder, in any ".js" file, if there is no step implementation then Error will raise.
